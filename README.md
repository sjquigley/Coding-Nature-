# Coding Nature

*Eliding code with multimodal composition methods to facilitate experiential learning in nature*<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Act 1: Undiscipling Environmental Education

### Multimodal Installation Project

In Finland there is no concept of Environmental Education


* what are nature schools?
* what happens at nature schools?
* what are the connections between environmental knowledge and environmental policy?

**Dilemma  of knowledge, authority, and power** *Who knows? Who decides who knows? Who decides who decides?* from Shoshona Zubhoff's *In the Age of The Smart Machines*

* should everyone know a little about code?
* if so, what is our responsibility  as educators?
* what other forces are at play?

## Act 3: My Nature Outing

![Child walking through the woods](naturewalk.jpg)

* is there value in combining code + multimodal methods + environmental science?
* how can I better recognize indigenous  knowledge/methods?
* how does this scale?
